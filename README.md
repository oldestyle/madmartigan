A Raspberry Pi Clustering Project

## Summary
The [Raspberry Pi](http://raspberrypi.org) is a single-board computer developed in the the UK with the intention of promoting the teaching of basic computer science in schools. The small form factor and low cost of the Raspberry Pi have made it ideal for more advanced research projects as well.

By building a cluster of Raspberry Pi computers, one can design and test complicated network configurations and sofware solutions while emulating a larger scale network. This keeps such development off of the production servers, and allows for rapid prototyping in Linux systems without using additional IT resources.



## Objectives
I intend to design and build a small cluster of Raspberry Pi computers and use the device for researching and developing advanced web serving solutions. The goal of this training and research is to improve performance and reliability of the College's website for all campuses.

### Advanced hardware design / build
Using equipment at Tenth St Campus, a custom case will be designed and built to contain the computing hardware.

### Load balancing with Drupal on Nginx
