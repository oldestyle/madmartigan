A Raspberry Pi Clustering Project

## Summary
The [Raspberry Pi](http://raspberrypi.org) is a single-board computer developed in the the UK with the intention of promoting the teaching of basic computer science in schools. The small form factor and low cost of the Raspberry Pi have made it ideal for more advanced research projects as well.

By building a cluster of Raspberry Pi computers, one can design and test complicated network configurations and sofware solutions while emulating a larger scale network. This keeps such development off of the production servers, and allows for rapid prototyping in Linux systems without using additional IT resources. Building a similar system with full-size computer hardware would be extremely expensive and require a large amount of space and electricity to operate.


## Objectives
I intend to design and build a small cluster of Raspberry Pi computers and use the device for researching and developing advanced web serving solutions. The goal of this training and research is to improve performance and reliability of the College's website for all campuses.

### Advanced hardware design / build
Using equipment at Tenth St Campus, a custom case will be designed and built to contain the computing hardware. New design and production techniques will be explored and documented through this process.

### Load balancing with Drupal on Nginx
> Load balancing across multiple application instances is a commonly used technique for optimizing resource utilization, maximizing throughput, reducing latency, and ensuring fault-tolerant configurations.

>It is possible to use nginx as a very efficient HTTP load balancer to distribute traffic to several application servers and to improve performance, scalability and reliability of web applications with nginx.
